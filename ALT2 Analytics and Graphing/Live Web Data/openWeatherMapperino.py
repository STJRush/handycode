# Things to do:

# Displaty the temperature in 째C instead of kelvin (subtract 273.15)

# Round this number using: whatYouWant = round(number_to_round, 2)   That's 2 decimal places.


# COVID SAFETY ALARM IDEA:

# Run this program on a Raspberri Pi. Use a DHT sensor to measure the actual room temperature indoors.

# Compare the Room Temperature to the Outside Weathermap Temperature. If the room temperature is 23째C and the outside temperature is 4째C then someone is very wrong. There is no way those classroom windows could be open (unless you're burning a fire indoors). You should notify the students in the room with an alarm sound or bright flashy LED lights! They're in a poorly ventilated area!
