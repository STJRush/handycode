Tasks: 

Take the block of code for your location eg. beach and make it function. 
A function is a few lines of code in a block with a name and brackets eg. beach() or spell()

Whenever you say that magic word (when you call the function), python will run that
block of code.


1. Name your function. Give your function a name eg.

Example 1: 
beach()

Example 2: 
forest()

2. Add proper syntax. Add "def" and a colon ":"  to define the function the first time you describe it.
This way python knows what to do when you call the function. eg.

Example 1: 
def beach():

Example 2: 
def forest():

3. Indent only the lines of code you want in your function.

Example 1: 

```python
def beach():
    print("Welcome to the beach")

# This is not in the function
print("Game Over")
```

Example 2: 
```python
def forest():
    print("Welcome to the beach")
    
# This is not in the function
print("Game Over")
```
