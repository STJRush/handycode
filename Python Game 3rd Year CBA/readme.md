# Python Text Based Adventure

- Use python to make a game where the player explores a world, unlocks secrets and fights the Big Bad Evil Guy.

- Start off with making your map with 3 locations on something like [inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/maps)


# Requirements (Expectations):
- Then in python (Lesson 1), create a block of code for that location. Here's one I made (https://github.com/STJRush/handycode/blob/master/Python%20Game%203rd%20Year%20CBA/BardinMarth.jpg) but yours just needs 3 locations.
- In (Lesson 2), turn that code block into a function() so that you can visit at any time eg. beach(), forest()
- Then in (Lesson 3) copy paste that function 2 more times so that you have 3 locations that link together.
- In (Lesson 4), create your inventory list: a bag, backpack, purse and find some loot.
- To make it less repeditive, make that loot crate *random* in (Lesson 5).
- In (Lesson 6), if you have the secret key in your list, you can open the secret door!
- But behind the secret door is a boss that you must fight in (Lesson 7)

## Don't stop there!

That is all you SHOULD have in your CBA but for further marks, ONCE YOU HAVE MET THESE REQUIREMENTS, you can add your own features. Here are some suggstions:

- Use pygame to add music, sound effects and pictures
- Use pygame to make a minimap to keep track of your location
- Use an LLM to make realistic chat with an NPC or boss

### THAR BE DRAGONS!

Here are some pitfalls that some students have had in the past:

- Do not add more than 3 main locations. Adding further locations will gets no more marks. (that's not counting the secret area with the boss fight). Adding 5 more stabilizers to your bike will not help. You get marks for more features not the same features five more times.

- Don't do any music or sounds or fancy things until the 7 main requirments above are complete.
