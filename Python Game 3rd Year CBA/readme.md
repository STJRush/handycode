# Python Text Based Adventure

- Use python to make a game where the player explores a world, unlocks secrets and fights the Big Bad Evil Guy.

- Start off with making your map with 3 locations on something like [inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/maps)

- Then in python (Lesson 1), create a block of code for that location. Here's one I made (https://github.com/STJRush/handycode/blob/master/Python%20Game%203rd%20Year%20CBA/BardinMarth.jpg) but yours just needs 3 locations.
- In (Lesson 2), turn that code block into a function() so that you can visit at any time eg. beach(), forest()
- Then in (Lesson 3) copy paste that function 2 more times so that you have 3 locations that link together.
- In (Lesson 4), create your inventory list: a bag, backpack, purse and find some loot.
- To make it less repeditive, make that loot crate random in (Lesson 5).
