# This is the code to run the MLX90614 Infrared Thermal Sensor
# You'll need to import the package "Adafruit Blinka"
# You'll need to import the package "adafruit-circuitpython-mlx90614/"
# You'll need to enable i2c on the pi https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-i2c/
# Reboot after enabling i2C
# Sensor is connected to 3.3V, GND and the i2C pins 3(SDA) and 5(SCL)
