# Simulations

### Two Variables:
1 and 2 predicts a given X if you know what Y is on an XY graph.

### More than two variables
1-5 involve three independant variables ABC predicting a fourth variable XY

Three variables you can put onto at 3D graph.

Four variables you can't visualise unless you are a higher dimenional alien species.
So we generally show multiple slices eg. we graph (A vs. X) then (B vs. X) then (C vs X) one at a time.
