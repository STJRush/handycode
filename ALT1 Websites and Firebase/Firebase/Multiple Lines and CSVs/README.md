# WTF are keys and values?

It's cool! You know this. They're the same as Names and Values. Like:

<i>Name : Value</i>

DannysAge : 99

BennysAge : 101

Python has a data type that's not a list or integer called a dictionary.
This is basically a database just like Firebase or a csv file.
It calls Names "keys". Go figure. Values are still values. Yay.
