# Start with "theBASICS_read_and_write_to_firebase.py"

My Read Data examples here rely people not deleting my data in the example firebase.
If silly people do delete stuff, you can re-populate it by running simTidyDataToFirebase.py above.

Things like RPi InternalTemp_write_to_csv.py or the DHT example need to Raspberry Pi to run as your PC won't have GPIO.

If want to pull down 100 points of temperture data from firebase into a csv for you to analyes, you should open the folder called "Multiple Lines and CSVs".
